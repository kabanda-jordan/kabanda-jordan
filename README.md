# 👋 Hi, I'm KABANDA JORDAN

Passionate **full‑stack** engineer and AI enthusiast focused on fintech, cybersecurity, and high‑performance systems. I enjoy turning complex systems into clean, testable code and building projects that run close to real‑world constraints (edge devices, low‑latency backends, security‑sensitive flows).

## 🚀 Latest projects 

These are the core repositories that best show how I think and build.

- **Flagship Project – Trading Journal / Analytics Platform**  
  Full‑stack app focused on real trading workflows, including risk insights, journaling, and analytics.  
  Highlights: clear problem → solution story, architecture diagram, tests, roadmap, and production‑style setup.

- **AI / ML Project – Fraud or Anomaly Detection**  
  ML pipeline with data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.  
  Highlights: metrics like precision, recall, F1; ablations; discussion of trade‑offs.

- **Cybersecurity Project – Blue/Red Team Tools & CTF Writeups**  
  Security utilities (log analyzer, vulnerability scanner, etc.) plus structured writeups of CTF challenges.  
  Highlights: threat model, attack scenarios, defense strategy, security trade‑offs.

- **Networking / Systems Project – Low‑Level Networking**  
  Socket‑based chat server, simple load balancer, or network monitor.  
  Highlights: concurrency, resource usage, benchmarks, and diagrams of data flow.

- **FinTech / Data Project – Quant / Risk Engine**  
  Backtesting engine, risk calculator, or portfolio optimizer with real or realistic market data.  
  Highlights: clear assumptions, risk metrics, and performance reports.

## 📚 Skill Proof 

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
  Organized solutions by topic (graphs, DP, trees, trading‑related), each with problem, approach, complexity, and notes.

- **Design Patterns in Practice**  
  Implementations of patterns like Factory, Strategy, Observer, Dependency Injection, and Repository, with short usage notes.

- **Clean Code & Testing Examples**  
  Focused repo demonstrating SOLID principles, unit tests, integration tests, and clear project structure.

## 🛠 Engineering Signals

To reflect real‑world engineering standards, I try to always include:

- **Tests** – unit and integration tests, plus coverage badge where useful.  
- **Architecture Diagrams** – system, data flow, and component layouts for non‑trivial projects.  
- **Benchmarks** – speed and memory comparisons for systems, AI, and performance‑critical tools.

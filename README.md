# 👋 Hi, I'm KABANDA JORDAN

Passionate **full‑stack** engineer and AI enthusiast focused on fintech, cybersecurity, and high‑performance systems. I enjoy turning complex systems into clean, testable code and building projects that run close to real‑world constraints (edge devices, low‑latency backends, security‑sensitive flows).

## 🛠 Engineering Signals

To reflect real‑world engineering standards, I try to always include:

- **Tests** – unit and integration tests, plus coverage badge where useful.  
- **Architecture Diagrams** – system, data flow, and component layouts for non‑trivial projects.  
- **Benchmarks** – speed and memory comparisons for systems, AI, and performance‑critical tools.
